### Step 1: Create a New Backend Project

1. **Create a New Directory:**
   - Create a new folder on your machine for the backend service, separate from your Angular project. 
   - For example, name it `my-node-backend`.

2. **Initialize Node.js Project:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to your newly created folder: `cd my-node-backend`.
   - Initialize a new Node.js project by running `npm init -y`.
   - This command creates a `package.json` file with default values.

### Step 2: Install Required Packages

1. **Install Express and Azure SDK:**
   - In the same directory (`my-node-backend`), install necessary NPM packages by running:
     ```bash
     npm install express @azure/storage-blob dotenv
     ```
   - `express` is a web framework for Node.js.
   - `@azure/storage-blob` is the Azure SDK for JavaScript for interacting with Azure Blob Storage.
   - `dotenv` is a module to load environment variables from a `.env` file.

### Step 3: Set Up the Basic Server

1. **Create the Server File:**
   - In the `my-node-backend` directory, create a new file named `server.js`.

2. **Write Basic Express Server Code:**
   - Open `server.js` and add the following code:
     ```javascript
     const express = require('express');
     const app = express();
     const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

     app.get('/', (req, res) => {
       res.send('Hello from Node.js Backend!');
     });

     app.listen(port, () => {
       console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
     });
     ```

### Step 4: Add Azure Blob Storage Integration

1. **Configure Azure Blob Storage SDK:**
   - In the `server.js`, add the code to integrate with Azure Blob Storage. Here's a basic template:
     ```javascript
     require('dotenv').config();
     const { BlobServiceClient } = require('@azure/storage-blob');

     // Load Azure storage configuration from environment variables
     const azureStorageConnectionString = process.env.AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING;

     // Create a BlobServiceClient
     const blobServiceClient = BlobServiceClient.fromConnectionString(azureStorageConnectionString);

     // Add more routes to handle Azure Blob operations...
     ```

2. **Create Routes for Blob Operations:**
   - You'll need to add Express routes to handle various Blob operations like upload, download, list, and delete.
   - Each route will use `blobServiceClient` to interact with Azure Blob Storage.

### Step 5: Add a `.env` File for Configuration

1. **Create `.env` File:**
   - In your `my-node-backend` directory, create a `.env` file.
   - Add the Azure Blob Storage connection string (you can find this in your Azure Storage account in the Azure portal):
     ```
     AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=your_connection_string_here
     ```
   - Make sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent committing it to version control.

### Step 6: Running the Backend Locally

1. **Start the Server:**
   - In your terminal, run `node server.js`.
   - Your server should start, and you should see a message indicating it's running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Step 7: Testing the Backend

1. **Test the Endpoints:**
   - Use a tool like Postman or a browser to test the `/` endpoint.
   - As you add more routes for Blob operations, test each of them to ensure they work as expected.

### Step 8: Developing Your Angular App

1. **Connect Angular to Node.js Backend:**
   - In your Angular service, make HTTP requests to your local Node.js backend.
   - Example: `httpClient.get('http://localhost:3000/list-blobs')` to list blobs.

### Step 9: Deployment

1. **Deploying to Azure:**
   - Once your backend is ready, follow the steps outlined in the previous deployment guide to deploy it to Azure.

This backend will now serve as the intermediary between your Angular frontend and Azure Blob Storage, handling all sensitive operations and credentials securely.
